 Why Apache?
=============

We have chosen the Apache v2.0 license because it is liberal and 
supports broad use and modification of the software.
The Apache license allows other projects with virtually any license,
including GPL, to use our code, and makes it more likely that we will
attract support from companies, including open-source software
companies, such as Enthought_ and Kitware_.
